# Introduction

Theses at the GSD and in the UPD department can address a variety of topics, can take many different forms, and can be developed using many different processes. My expectations for the students I advise are quite a bit narrower. The purpose of this document is to clearly articulate those expectations so that students can make an informed choice about whether I would be an appropriate thesis advisor, based on their own goals for their thesis.
