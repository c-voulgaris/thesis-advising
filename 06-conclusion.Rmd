# Concluding thoughts

There is a common saying that "The best thesis is a finished thesis." My goal is for you to finish your thesis, and that will inevitably mean that I will occasionally encourage you to drop a line of inquiry that you find interesting and important, or to stop working on part of your project and move on, even when you know it isn't perfect yet.

Ideally your thesis marks the _beginning_ of a journey that will span the rest of your career. After my time as your thesis advisor concludes, I will continue to follow your career with interest, and I'm sure I will see your thinking on the questions that motivated your thesis research evolve over time.
