# Topics 

I will accept thesis students whose projects fall within the scope of one or more standing committee of the Transportation Research Board. You can search for standing committees [here](https://www.mytrb.org/OnlineDirectory/Committee/){target="_blank"} (check the box for “Standing Committee” under the Committee Type heading).
