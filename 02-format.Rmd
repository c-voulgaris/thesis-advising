# Thesis format

I will advise students who will produce a written thesis. There is no minimum page or word count. My preference is for you to write as succinctly as possible while fully describing your project.

Your thesis should be organized into the following chapters. The chapters do not need to have these names, but they should serve the functional purpose described below.

## Introduction

The introduction should clearly state a research question, briefly explain why the question is important, and summarize the answer to that question. It should also breifly summarize each of the subsequent chapters.

## Literature review

The literature should summarize prior research that has been done by other scholars that relates to your research question. The purpose of this summary is for the reader to place your research findings in the proper context.

## Methods

The methods chapter should describe your research approach in enough detail that an interested and motivated reader could replicate your work. Some details (for example, survey instruments or raw datasets) might need to included by reference to an appendix.

## Results

The results chapter should summarize the results of your analysis.

## Discussion

The discussion chapter should relate the results back to the literature you've summarized in your literature review chapter. There will be strong parallels between the discussion chapter and the literature review chapter.

## Conclusion
The conclusion chapter should summarize the rest of your thesis and will have strong parallels with the introduction. A reader should be able to understand your overall argument and the support for it by reading only the introduction and conclusion.
