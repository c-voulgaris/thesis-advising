# Advising meetings

I will meet with the thesis students I am advising as a group (if I am advising multiple students) on a biweekly basis throughout Fall and Spring semesters of the thesis year. At the beginning of each semester, we will coordinate as a group to find a mutually convenient time for these recurring meetings. 

Students should come to these meeting prepared to share their progress using two or three slides. These can be very simple. Preparation for these advising meetings should contribute to your progress on your thesis rather than being an additional task that comes at the expense of such progress.

I am also available to meet with students outside of these regular advising meetings. You can sign up for a meeting with me using my [office hours scheduler](https://carole-voulgaris.youcanbook.me/){target="_blank"}.
